1. Case Study - Ethics Analysis
File: projects/1-case_study_ethics/analysis.md
# Case Study: Ethical Dilemmas in AI Applications

Overview
This case study explored the ethical dilemmas surrounding the implementation of AI systems, particularly in healthcare and employment.

---

Key Ethical Issues
- **Bias in AI Algorithms**: Analyzing systemic bias in hiring AI tools.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Ethical risks associated with predictive health monitoring.
- **Accountability**: Who is responsible when AI fails?

---

Findings
After reviewing key case studies and research papers, it was evident that:  
- Transparent AI decision-making leads to higher trust among end-users.  
- Bias mitigation strategies must be at the forefront of all AI development pipelines.

# Importing Necessary Libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Loading the Dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/dataset.csv')

# Data Preprocessing
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Splitting Data
X = data[['feature_1', 'feature_2']]
y = data['target']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Training Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Visualize Predictions
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions)
plt.xlabel("Actual Values")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Values")
plt.title("Prediction vs Actual")
plt.show()
